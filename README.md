Contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the [EconModel package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/EconModel).

If you are **new to Python** then try out this online course, [Introduction to programming and numerical analysis](https://sites.google.com/view/numeconcph-introprog/home).

**To get started:**

1. Install the EconModel package (requires git): ``pip install EconModel``
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open your notebook of choice

We recommend running the notebooks in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

A set of guides on how to install Python and JupyterLab is available [here]https://sites.google.com/view/numeconcph-introprog/guides).

**Use in practice:**

For model with consumption-saving you can use the [ConSav package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSaving).

For solving heterogenous agent models you can use the [GEModelTools package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/GEModelTools).
